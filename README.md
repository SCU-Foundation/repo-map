This repository contains the canonical, authoritative map of the SCU ecosystem’s GitHub organisation.

The REPO‑MAP is the single source of truth for:
- repository names  
- folder structures  
- file inventories  
- architectural domains  
- standards and specifications placement  
- governance and legal surfaces  
- publication surfaces  
- website repositories  

This document is maintained by the SCU Foundation and reflects the final, governance‑aligned architecture of the ecosystem.
