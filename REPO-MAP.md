# REPO‑MAP
Version: vE1.1  
Status: Active Canonical Document  
Maintained by: SCU Foundation  
Document Class: Repository Index (Group B)

This document defines the complete repository structure of the SCU ecosystem.  
It is the authoritative source of truth for:

- repository layout  
- required admin files  
- canonical folder structure  
- cross‑repo alignment  
- global refactor operations  
- ecosystem‑wide file‑reference rules  

All repositories MUST conform to this structure.

# 0. Repository List (Ecosystem Era vE1.x)

The SCU ecosystem contains the following repositories:

- **Architecture**  
- **Governance**  
- **Legal**  
- **Standards**  
- **Specifications**  
- **Repo‑Map** (this repository)

Future repositories (e.g., websites, whitepaper) are excluded from this map.

---

# 1. Required Root‑Level Admin Files (All Admin‑Grade Repos)

Every admin‑grade repository MUST contain the following files at root:

- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `LICENSE`
- `STATUS.md`
- `VERSION`
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `GOVERNANCE.md`
- `STRUCTURE.md`

These files define:

- governance  
- contribution rules  
- repository structure  
- licensing  
- versioning  
- behavioural expectations

# 2. Repository Maps

Each repository is listed with:

- **EXISTS** — file already present  
- **TO BE CREATED** — file required but missing  
- **TO BE UPDATED** — file exists but must be refactored  
- **TO BE REMOVED** — file should not exist
